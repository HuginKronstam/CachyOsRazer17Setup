Born with a silver spoon in his mouth, Björke was always making trouble. People close to him, his fathers servants especially, knew what a little devil he was, the disrespect he would show them and the pranks he would play on them, but to people who did not know his true self, he was as charming as can be. As he grew older, he quickly fell in nicely with the high status socialites of Halruaa, his impeccable Tiefling beauty, and ability to master almost any skill he encountered granted him much praise, he lived a lavish lifestyle leeching of his so-called friends. However, he grew tired of the lifestyle with time, and his inner demons shined through more and more, he started sneaking off at the parties, and finding information and secrets that were not for him to know.
 
This information he able to levy in his favour, and he quickly gained an upper hand in the world of politics and mastered the ability to extort people and forge documents to sow discord between groups that could help him climb the social ladder.
 
10 years ago, Björke stole classified documents that could lead to war between Halruaa and its neighbouring nation, they described an affair happening in some very high political circles, Björke doctored the documents to blame the heir of a rival family and smuggled the documents out under his lover, Denicé' dress without her knowledge. She was however caught and executed for treason, and the person he blamed was punished with a lifetime in jail.
 
Since the incident Björke has dived deeper into the criminal underbelly of Haluaa. Not many know that the master spy known only as "He who bears false witness" is in truth Björke.
