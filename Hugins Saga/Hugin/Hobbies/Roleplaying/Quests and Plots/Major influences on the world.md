This section aims to explain the major organizations in the World of Kaldashia, their motives, progress and important members.
 
N.O.W - No Other Way, Night of Worship, No opportunity waits,  
This faction is placed all around the world in strategic places, they have their own banking system and their own currency, to normal people they are known as an Arcane order that spreads their influence for the good of the world, bridging economic differences and connecting the humanoids of the world.
 
In truth they are a shadow organisation that aims to capture the grand vessels and drain the world of all Mana, defeat Yaigmoth and leave the world in ruin with their new found power. The N.O.W are led by a "mind flayer Elder brain."
 
The grand vessels are the hearts of the 5 elemental Great Wyrms living on Dominaria.
 
Cults of Alara  
Alara is home to 5 powerful cults that each worship one of the primal aspects of mana and therefore also the Titan associated with it.
