Your adventure starts on the Shard of Necra, a hot and arid land consisting mostly of Savannah, the further to the east you go, the more desolate it becomes ending in open plains. The more east one travels the denser the vegetation becomes. In the south an abundance of water coupled with poor natural flow has let to massive bogs and swamps.  
Finally to the north lies a great wall with only one entrance to Selesnya, a sprawling cityscape.
