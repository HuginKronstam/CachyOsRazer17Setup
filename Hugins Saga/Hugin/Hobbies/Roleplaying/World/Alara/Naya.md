Naya is the Green aligned shard of Alara, it's secondary colours are White and Red.
 
Nature  
The shard of Naya is a wild and mostly untamed place, it consists mostly of immense jungle, taiga, massive mountain plateaus and lush savannahs. Mundane things such as beasts and insects have evolved to be massive in this harsh and unforgiving environment. Survival of the fittest reigns supreme here and even the plat life is out to get you. In this brutal environment you either tame your surroundings or conquer them, if not you are prey.

Society  
There are two primary beliefs on Naya. _Hunt or be Hunted_, and the _Embrace_.
 
Hunt or be Hunted: Big game hunters and survivalists make up this cult, they believe strongly in the thrill of the hunt and survival of the fittest. They hunt behemoths and other wildlife and often settle disputes among themselves with grand hunting games of either beasts or each other.
 
Embrace: This is a collective of Druidic circles who live in harmony with the untamed wilds of Naya. They live off the land and protect it with their wild allies. They are quite isolated and preserve nature. They are at open war with the goblin prospectors and minotaurs of Naya.
