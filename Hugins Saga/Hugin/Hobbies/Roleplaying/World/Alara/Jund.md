Nature  
The mountains of Jund are as dangerous as they are beautiful. These  
hostile lands are home to many savage species and despite the uninviting nature of the these lands, most inhabitants wish nothing else than to thrive here. Among the mountains can be found fertile Taigas, volcanic islands in boiling oceans and teething peaks. The savageness of the shard is only matched by its inhabitants who prospect in the rich veins of the rigid landscape. Dwarfs, goblins and vulshok dig ever deeper in their never ending passion for riches while they battle each other for territory.
