Grixis is the Black aligned shard of Alara, it's secondary colours are Blue and Red.
 
Nature  
Grixis is a dark and twisted place. A heavy mist looms over the shard which mostly consists of swamps, bogs, badlands, and tangled underground cave systems complete with lairs, lanes and mires. The whole place reeks of rot and pestilence. The sun seldom shines and the land seems to weep for its unfortunate inhabitants. The undead have taken a liking to this place along with troglodytes and other foul creatures. Strange vents spew a gaseous substance from the earth. This substance is known as vis, and it is rich in mana. Apart from being a potent fuel, it's also highly acidic and seems to be the cause of the constant fog on the shard along with the rot and decay of most living things.
