Obelisks in the world of Kaldashia are arcane constructions that harness and transport immense power.  
There are 3 types of Obelisks all created by Yaigmoth they are as follows:
 
Mana obelisks.  
On each shard of Dominaria immense obelisks stand and channel the power of each individual shard. The obelisks interconnect and allows the flow of mana to connect and shape the regions of the world.
 
Transport Spires.  
Several transport spires are located around the world of Kaldashia, these interconnect with each other as well as the nexus. Powerful individuals or appointed officials are given access to utilize these constructs.  
The spires act as conduits, and allow transport of people and goods from one to the other. This instantaneous mean of travel is obviously very sought after.
 
The inhibitors.  
The inhibitors are located in the middle of each shard of Alara. They isolate Kaldashia from the rest of the multiverse and inhibit planeswalking and traveling to other planes. By locals of the area the inhibitors are seen as cursed and many across the world aim to eliminate their existence, but none have succeeded.
