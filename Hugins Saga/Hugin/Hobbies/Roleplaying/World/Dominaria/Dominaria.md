General  
Dominaria is the basic region of Kaldashia and each shard inhabits one source of mana. All other regions are what they are as a result of mixing the basic mana types found in Dominaria.  
The regions of Dominaria are wild and mostly uninhabited. The _savage_ chromatic dragons roam the landscape and elementals of the appropriate element are a common siting. Each shard in Dominaria is also dominated by a titan, these demigod like beings never seem to leave their shard and obliterate anything that goes against their will.
