Ondu
 
Nature  
Like most of Zendikar, Ondu is unstable, its geography defy natural law and common sense. Scattered floating islands create the horizon and each have their own unique climate, botany and wildlife. The only common feature is the lack of stone's and other similar elements. The landscape seems vertically challenged. And the places that have water seems to keep it due to the lack of natural ways to transport it around.
 
Bestiary  
Each of the floating islands have its own distinct bestiary only common feature seems to be the lack of ferocious hunters, as with most of Zendikar flying creatures have a huge upper hand in these harsh lands.
