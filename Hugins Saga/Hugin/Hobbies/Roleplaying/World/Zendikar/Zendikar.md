General  
The region of Zendikar is located between Alara and Ravnica. With no tie to any specific type of mana these shards are very unstable and are more known for what they are not rather than what they are. They manifest all types of mana apart from the one most distant to them. The landscapes are mostly void with scattered floating islands. The metallic dragons have claimed this area as their home.
