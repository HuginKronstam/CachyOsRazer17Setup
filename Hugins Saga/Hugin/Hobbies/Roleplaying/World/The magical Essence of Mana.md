In the world of Kaldashia mana is abundant, it is something all living and undead creatures create passively, but given the right rituals and circumstances the process can be accelerated, harnessed and exploited.
 
Mana shapes the lands and the minds of it's inhabitants weather they want it or not.  
This material can have a passive and active form.
 
Active form:  
In its active form it can flow freely and propagate. However it is hard to control in this form, and will mostly do its own bidding. As an example, an undead army will slowly transform a vivid and wild forest into a swampy bog by simply being there, but on the same note, the land can fight back and transform the limited consciousness of the undead. In the short term whatever is stronger will triumph. However, given enough time if nothing can triumph the powers of mana will merge to form more complex manifestations.
 
Passive form:  
If mere mortals wish to control mana it must be solidified into vessels and assume its passive form. This process of controlling mana drains some of it's potency by sealing it off from the flow of the world. However it also allows the user to forge it's remaining potency into powerful artefacts with which an individual can use to influence the world.
 
Harnessing mana requires the user to transfer the arcane power into vessels. Soulstones, rare gemstones and hearts of arcane beings are the most common vessels. Once the vessel has been filled, its powers can be transferred via the ritual of manaforging. This permanently transfers the arcane power into the artefact of choice in a irreversible action granting it newfound potential.
 
Vessels are rare in the world of Kaldashia. The dead vessels are perfect gems and soulstones, these are limited to how much power they can store. The alternative vessels are hearts of arcane beings such as dragons and demons these grow over the lifespan of the creature and hold untold potential. Extremely skilled artificers and mages even hold the hearts in living stasis and allow the vessels to grow over time even after they have been extracted.
