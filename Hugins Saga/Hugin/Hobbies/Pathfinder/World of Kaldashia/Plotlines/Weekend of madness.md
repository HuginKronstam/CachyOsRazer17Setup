Loot from last time

Drinking game
 
Goblin's Eye:  
Basically it's darts. Player's take turns rolling 1d20 and 1d6 (3 times). The d20 determines what number they hit. The d6 determines where on the number it hits. (for example a 1 is in the outer ring, a 6 is in the bull's eye.) First player to 301, wins.
 
Crown & Anchor:  
A betting game. Player's can put any amount of gold on a grid numbered 1 through 6. They then roll 3d6 one time. If 1 die match their bet number, they win 1X the original bet. If 2 dice match their bet number, they win 2X the original bet.  
If 3 dice match their bet number, they win 3X the original bet.  
If 0 die match their bet number, they lose the original bet.
 
Three's:  
Simple dice game. All players ante. They take turns rolling 5d6. All numbers on the die are face value except for 3's which are worth 0. Lowest score wins the pot.

**Medivh**  
Gives the players the quest to retrieve the heart of Fafner (legendary blue dragon)  
Which is located in Oboro the center of the scar of the world but first they must travel to urzatron and meet with urza and finally get to know the N.O.W
   

**Urzatron**  
Is the capital of the sapphire isles and home to Urza the grand artificer  
This city looks smoothly on the surface, it is a highly magical place with tonnes of different races meandering the streets.  
The city is policed by golems of Urza's contruction  
Each of its 5 regions
   

**White:** The merchant quarter no ruler, tonnes of shops, taverns, guilds and Shrines. Pleasing Agothiron gives acces to the rest of the city. Also holds the bank of N.O.W in the center of the quarter.
 
**Quests:**  
The box of greed:  
Agothiron always tests people the same way, they must prove they value something more than the material world to gain acces to the higher tiers of the city. This is done by retrieving a small lockbox. If the box is opened when returned the quest is failed and acces is denied.  
The box is retrieved by getting it from the end of the dungeon of lairt  
The lair has junk golems as guards

And several traps to guard the lockbox  
Traps
 
The murder of the merchant Malipulus  
A local merchant has been killed and the heroes get asked if they want to find the murderer, and retrive and return his bag of holding.  
The corpse of Malipulus can be found in the autopsy department of the infirmary  
It shows signs of fresh stab wounds, brain hermoraging, and poison.  
The party must request info specifically since the golem transfering the answers has a limited consciousness.
 
The missing convoy  
A convoy of ore has gone missing in the mountain pass, intercepted by a raiding party of 4 local elves that used to be in the city but have stopped coming there after learning that the N.o.W is there and hurting the land.
