Realyt now known as the god of justice, was once a mortal like anyone else.
 
Legends say that Realyt was once a mortal man, he was the man who put an end to the corrupt priesthood of: Nyesten the Claimer of Rights.
 
Using mostly persuasive techniques he turned them, and changed their values, from exploitation to salvation, and from xenophobia to tolerance.
 
This only worked on the lower priesthood though, for the high priests Realyt would need real power, he got this the only way he knew how, by helping others claim justice, by any means nessesary.
 
He traveled the known world to seek power, power that could help him rid this world of injustice and corruption forever. On his way he became a skilled dipliomat of both the tongue and the sword.
 
When he returned to his homeland, he marched on the main cathedral with an army of followers in his back. When he was done with his crusade, some had repented, most had been slain.￼Realyt took over and made his own priesthood, and somehow through the relics of his enemies and the faith of his followers he ascended to become the God of Justice.
