Sure! This was a super fun project and I'd be happy to talk about it with anyone who's interested in trying it out for themselves.  
Even if you're new to this, I have some good news: I was also completely new to this process when I first started out. I'm not an editor or publisher, and had never worked on anything even remotely near this scale before. In fact, I was inspired to do this after I saw [another fellow redditor's Worm prints](https://www.reddit.com/r/Parahumans/comments/oynmnf/i_edited_designed_and_printed_my_own_copies_of/) on the subreddit, and a great deal of my own work was informed by his willingness to lend guidance and support on the process. I was a complete amateur going into this, so it was a lot of work finding the right resources and learning how to use them, but I learned so much and by the end of it I was grateful for investing the amount of time that I did.  
Most of what I send here is going to be quoted from [u/Prometheus1](https://old.reddit.com/u/Prometheus1), since we used pretty much the same process and he wrote a fairly comprehensive summary of how we put everything together [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Parahumans/comments/oynmnf/i_edited_designed_and_printed_my_own_copies_of/hfclf0f/).  
All of the interior setup and formatting was done in Adobe InDesign, a publishing and page layout software used by many editors. There are probably other programs you could use, but InDesign has just about everything you need and is the software most compatible with the printing service I used, which was [Lulu.com](http://lulu.com/). This could all technically be done in Word, but it'd be much, much harder, the result would be less refined, and you'd save yourself a lot of grief by getting and learning how to use InDesign.  
If you choose to print your books with Lulu (highly recommended), go through their options and mock up a book order before you start, so that you know what your final product will look like and what specs you'll be designing to. They have a ~30 page pdf on how to create books with them and you should read that too. You'll want to keep it on hand as a reference throughout the process. They will also provide you with templates for covers and interior pages that you should rely on.  
I used Word to prep the text and InDesign to assemble everything. The first step is editing the text and getting it ready for formatting as a book. The minimum text prep you'll want to do is bring each chapter into Word, remove the highlighting and change the text to black, set your font of choice (choose one known for common use in books, I used Adobe Garamond Pro) and the font size, and run a spellcheck. I did this an arc at a time. Depending on how you want to balance quality vs time, you can also run searches to find and remove double spaces and double paragraph returns, update hyphens that should be em-dashes, space the dots in each ellipses like so: ... --\> . . . (this is standard book formatting) and look for other quirks like backwards quotes.  
This is also when I would cross-check each chapter with their respective typo threads (all of the chapters have comments pointing out any typos/errors readers would find) and make those changes, because most are things spellcheck doesn't find. They're not consistently labeled until pretty late in the story, so I would Ctrl+F each comment section for words like "typo," "edit," "change," "spelling," etc. It helped me catch a lot of pretty major mistakes and inconsistencies, but it was by far the most time consuming step, so fair warning. Even after this, I ran the entire text through Word's editor one more time, to correct spelling mistakes, punctuation errors, and typos that no one else had pointed out.  
Once the Word docs were done I would import them directly into InDesign to do the actual design. If you do want to use InDesign, [this online course](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/designing-a-book-2/creating-a-book-in-indesign) will tell you everything you need to know about making a book (I believe they have a free trial option if you want to speedrun the course without paying for it). Watch it through at least once, take notes, and have it available to reference as you set up your first file. The methods taught in the course were invaluable in helping me learn how to navigate the software, which I was completely new to at the time. Before I found it, I had been teaching myself the program on my own, and felt a little dumb after finding out that many of things I had been doing manually had tools in place for automating and streamlining the process.  
Go through any printed novels you have and use the nicest looking ones as references for designing your pages. I had a stack of five or six books on my desk that I was regularly checking throughout the process. I can share the general interior set up I used here:  
Book dimensions: 6x9 in  
Margins:  
Top: 0.7874 in  
Bottom: 0.5906 in  
Inside: 0.9861 in  
Outside: 0.7639 in  
Gutter: 0.1667 in  
Text:  
Font: Adobe Garamond Pro  
Size: 10 pt  
Leading: 12 pt  
Make sure that at no point in this process do you override the original formatting, i.e, don't lose where Wildbow intentionally made words and passages italic.  
After this, there's one last editing process in which the text needs to be "finessed" - in other words, bringing it up to conventional print novel standards. This involves things like fixing weird spacing, getting rid of hanging lines, etc. These details may seem excessive or unnecessary, but they're actually pretty important in getting your book looking as clean and "professional" looking as possible. The specifics of this and much more can be found in the online course I sent, which explains it much better than I can.  
It was only after the typesetting and editing process was complete that I started to work on the covers. This is where you'll have the most creative control over the process, and it was the stage of the project that I was looking forward to the most! However you choose to design your covers is completely up to you - they're your books and you can't do anything wrong with them. Artwork was the first thing I tackled here - we commissioned the illustrations and various other art assets from [@Calamari-Pop](https://twitter.com/CalamariPop/media?lang=en), who also wrote the blurbs on the back of each book. She actually made a completely different set of covers for her version of the books, which you can check out [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Parahumans/comments/x9ace2/my_personal_hardcover_printed_version_of_worm/)!  
I created my covers in InDesign as well, but Lulu also gives you the option of using Canva or a template cover creator provided by them. However you choose to make them, make sure you're getting your dimensions and spine width right - the width of the spines will be dependent on the page count of each book (this is also why you'll want to wait until after you've finished the interior files to assemble your covers).  
After all of this is done, you're ready to print!  
Miscellaneous tips and notes:

- Double-check everything! I was constantly looking for errors in things like title spelling, consistent text settings, headers and chapter titles being where they should be, etc.
- As you're compiling the text, keep in mind that Lulu has an 800-page limit on their printed books. With the divisions I used, I had to play around with things like text size and even font type to make sure each book stayed within the maximum page count.
- Once you have your page set up and interior design the way you like it, I recommend creating a base document with all of those settings preset - margins, text styles, preliminary front matter (title page, copyright, first new arc page), etc. and use that as your template every time you start a new book. I used this same technique with the covers, so that they each looked consistent with each other.
- Compile and design the longest book first. I designed the third book first since it had the highest word count. Once you figure out the design choices and settings that keep that one within the maximum page count, then you know you'll be good for all the other books. Better than having things work out for the first two only to get to the third and find out you're way over and need to make changes across the board.
- Once you're ready to print, order only one book first as a test copy to proof for any errors or inconsistencies you might have missed throughout the process. If all goes well, there won't be any, and you can order the rest altogether. In the case that you do find mistakes, you can go back and fix them before ordering the whole set and finding the same errors crop up across all your books.

Good luck! If you do end up doing this, feel free to message me at any time if you have questions or need help!

Here's what I sent some other people who asked the same:  
Hi, thanks for the message, I appreciate your enthusiasm! A lot of the decisions I made and things I already knew how to do are the product of years of work and study in design so it would be difficult to relay how to achieve the same results, but I can definitely point you to some resources and give you some tips.  
Lulu.com is a great resource for getting these printed. Go through their options and mock up a book order before you start, so that you know what your final product will look like and what specs you'll be designing to. They have a ~30 page pdf on how to create books with them and you should read that too. You'll want to keep it on hand as a reference throughout the process. They will also provide you with templates for covers and interior pages that you should rely on.  
If you want to do this the same way I did, you'll use Word to prep the text and Adobe InDesign to assemble everything. The books can be made with Word alone if you don't want to buy/learn InDesign, but the result will be a lot less refined. That's how most or all of the other Worm prints that people have made were done. If you do want to use InDesign, [this online course](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/designing-a-book-2/creating-a-book-in-indesign) will tell you everything you need to know about making a book.  
The minimum text prep you'll want to do is bring each chapter into Word, remove the highlighting and change the text to black, set your font of choice (choose one known for common use in books) and the font size, and run a spellcheck. I did this an arc at a time. Depending on how you want to balance quality vs time, you can also run searches to find and remove double spaces and double paragraph returns, update hyphens that should be em-dashes, and look for other quirks like backwards quotes. This is also when I would go through the typo threads and make those changes, because most are things spellcheck doesn't find. They're not consistently labeled until pretty late in the story, so I would Cmd+F each comment section for the words "typo" "edit" and "change." It helped me catch a lot of pretty major mistakes and inconsistencies, but it was by far the most time consuming step, so fair warning.  
Once the word docs were done I would import them directly into InDesign to do the actual design. Go through any printed novels you have and use the nicest looking ones as references for this. My primary reference was my copy of The Help, but I was regularly checking 4 or 5 other books too.  
Make sure that at no point in this process do you override the original formatting, i.e, don't lose where wildbow intentionally made words and passages italic.  
Good Luck!
