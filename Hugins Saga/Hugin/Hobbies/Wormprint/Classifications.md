The classification system was initially created by the PRT ground-patrol and response teams in New York as a means of quickly identifying threats and adopting strategies. As many as thirty categories were added to accommodate other types of parahuman as the methodology spread, and these forms were later condensed as it was discovered that certain strategies were valid against parahumans of a broad type.
 
The number rating is a ballpark scale for the threat to a team, rather than any indication of the raw strength of an ability. Adjust for possibility of harm, panic, an exceptionally high degree of control that might allow one to target specific team members or civilians, or exceptionally low degrees of control that might point to collateral damage, spreading effects or aftereffects. The PRT stresses the pairing of number rating with power to encourage immediate and intuitive grasp of appropriate responses to a given crisis.
 
It is the responsibility of PRT operatives and parahumans to familiarize themselves with the current ratings for all relevant threats.
 
Number Estimation
 
1 Poses a threat only just above human norms, an unexceptional individual may be able to cope with the ability or walk away unharmed from an altercation where the abilities in question were leveraged. Ability should be assumed to be a nonthreat and need not be identified if other matters prove more pressing.  
2 An alert, exceptional, well equipped, and/or trained individual should be able to answer or address the ability in question, but it can prove problematic. Team members are reminded of standard countermeasures and should put these measures in effect when there are no pressing other matters  
3 Civilians, even alert or fit civilians, will not be able to handle the ability or abilities in question. Several trained individuals may be required to deal with the situation. Protocol suggests that care should be taken to remove civilians from the area and discourage them from participating.  
4 One full squad of trained operatives should be able to deal with this situation alone, but exceptional circumstance, context and environment may bias things one way or the other.  
5 Additional countermeasures come into effect. A typical parahuman and/or one parahuman assisting a squad of operatives should be able to deal with the power in question. Operatives can engage until assistance arrives.  
6 A typical trained parahuman and/or one parahuman assisting a squad of operatives should be able to deal with the power in question. Operatives should postpone engagement.Parahumans and operatives should assume that traditional actions are going to be met by a complication. Acquiring further intel recommended where possible, but not mandated.  
7 Parahumans should engage in pairs or trios at a minimum, two fully equipped squads should be deployed. Acquiring further intel is mandated, all acting parties should shift to the defensive or delay until intel can be acquired.  
8 Evacuation of civilians should take priority for all squad members. Engaging should be avoided outside of specific missions and tasks. Capes should engage only when supported by their team to ensure a minimum of complications or danger.  
9 Assume extreme complications, with standard tactics not applying, or the power in question having an additional factor that exaggerates its effect. Capes and PRT should evacuate where possible, and should only engage when a specific mission and strategy has been outlined. Major countermeasures should take effect.  
10+ In the event of a serious confrontation, additional teams or specific high-rated individuals should be called in to manage the crisis.
 
In the categories themselves, parahumans fall into the following classifications, with the following countermeasures:
 
Mover  
Has the ability to transport themselves and/or others to other locations, by means of enhanced speed, teleportation, flight, vehicles or the like. General response is to limit movements where possible, anticipate attack from any direction. When declared in the field, if possible, append classification with type. Mover: Teleporter!  
Threat level 2+: Communicate mover nature. Where possible, move fight to a contained area where free-ranging movement is less effective, targeting objectives or other threats to draw attention and focus. Lock down area.  
Threat level 5+: Assume containment is impossible. Clearance granted for truck-mounted nonlethal measures (net launchers, foam sprayers) that might otherwise inconvenience locals. Threat level  
9+: Higher office and PRT offices in nearby or neighboring cities should be notified of possible threat or retaliation in case of confrontation.
 
Shaker  
Can affect a broader area, asserting some degree of control over the battlefield. May include gas, explosions, forcefields, and ambient or radiated effects. General response is to spread out, minimizing the shaker's ability to affect multiple individuals at once.  
Threat level 2+: Communicate shaker nature. Where possible, move or stagger fight locations with some regularity, to slow their ability to seize total command over a battlefield. Shaker-class threats take high priority, and can or should be baited out and taken out of action.  
Threat level 5+: All individuals should remain as mobile as possible, operating alone or in pairs. Evacuate the area, and personnel are warned not to rely too much on cover, environmental advantages, or situational advantages. Stagger confrontations, leaving an area when identified.  
Threat level 9+: Evacuation takes utmost priority.
 
Brute  
Has enhanced strength or durability, most dangerous in a melee, typically very difficult to put down. While the execution may remain fairly stable, the source of this power can vary. General response depends on degree of brute classification, but should involve focusing fire, limiting movements, and maintaining a safe distance.  
Threat level 2+: Communicate brute nature. Assume divided fire will not have any serious effect, and devote focused fire to the target. Treat as low priority unless movements cannot be restricted, in which case the brute can be escalated to moderate priority.  
Threat level 5+: Assume standard munitions are not going to hamper the brute. Lethal munitions are authorized, truck emplacements are authorized. Property damage should be expected and accounted for. Where possible, move fight to an open area.  
Threat level 9+: Inter-city missile emplacements and other large scale munitions are authorized. Assume standard parahuman abilities are not going to hamper the target.
 
Breaker  
Has the ability to alter themselves to a different state in which they maintain different abilities. Appends other powers, but only in this state. Can also include general altered states. Target the individual outside of any enhanced state where possible. All other effects depend on the sub-classification.
 
Master  
Has the ability to control others. Can include degrees of control (swaying attitudes or emotions) and a wealth of controlled entities (individuals, animals, objects, created beings). Numbers assumed to be equal, masters take second highest priority and are targeted first.  
Threat level 2+: Team is notified as to master classification. Master prioritized as target, with likely location regularly communicated to team and oversight, to allow expedient removal.  
Threat level 5+: Assuming nonhuman, non-sapient minions, full lethal munitions are authorized against any massed forces. In case of controlled humans, all standard 'eyes-on' protocols are in effect (see Changer and Stranger). Passwords in effect.  
Threat level 9+: Inter-city missiles and other large-scale munitions may be authorized, depending on the situation.
 
Tinker  
Can create devices or alter existing devices well beyond usual restrictions of education, knowledge, resources, and/or physics. Tinkers are less dangerous when removed from their gear, but should not be assumed to be harmless. A typical tinker can artificially assume any number of other classifications, depending on specialty. Specialty should be appended to the classification in every case possible. (ie. phasing specialty or electricity specialty)  
Threat level 2+: Team is notified as to tinker classification. Disruption is encouraged, with use of flashbangs.  
Threat level 5+: Electromagnetic pulses are authorized to disrupt gear, with some property damage likely.  
Threat level 9+: Other tinkers or liasons should be contacted to better inform about capabilities and to answer immediate threats.
 
Blaster  
Ranged, offensive attacks of some form. Can include blasts, thrown or moved objects, grenades. Not always damaging, but generally deleterious. Response varies greatly depending on the nature of the blaster. At low levels, cover is highly recommended. At higher levels, movement is a higher priority, and cover should be assumed to be useless.  
Threat level 2+: Team is notified as to blaster classification so they can take cover at next opportunity. Frequent reporting on blaster's location and likely direction of fire are encouraged. Suppression of ranged fire is encouraged but not mandated.  
Threat level 5+: Resources and/or personnel are devoted to pressuring the blaster threat, keeping them moving and focused on a target to protect other personnel. Truck-mounted emplacements may be necessary to apply sufficient pressure.  
Threat level 9+: Evacuation of likely firing zone is prioritized. Responding to high-caliber ranged threat is likely to necessitate matching response, if civilians or property are endangered. Inter-city missiles and other large-scale weapons are authorized.
 
Thinker  
Possesses enhanced knowledge, skills and/or perceptions beyond any reasonable norm. Includes clairvoyance, precognition, skill acquisition, enhanced hearing and enhanced sight. Thinker capes, all numbers assumed to be equal, take the highest priority in engagements.  
Threat level 2+: Team is notified as to thinker classification. Communication should be limited and the thinker should be cut off from teammates where possible. Encrypted or coded communications may be necessary. Failing that, the operation may need to be silent (noncommunicative team).  
Threat level 5+: Maximum disruption to the senses, with flashbangs and nonlethal truck emplacements put into regular effect. All possible measures should be undertaken to keep the thinker threat from communicating. Pre-prepared thinker countermeasures (false information) should be entered into play. PRT thinkers should be contacted remotely to maximize counter-thinking.  
Threat level 9+: Contact the head office to discuss needs and resources available.
 
Striker  
Has a power that applies on physical contact. Often applies a changed state, like the breaker classification, but isn't personal. Melee range, but not strength or durability, as per Brute. General response is to maintain a set distance and maintain visual on the striker. Open areas are preferrable to cramped quarters.  
Threat level 2+: Team is notified as to the striker classification. Formation should maintain a distance. Foam sprayers authorized.  
Threat level 5+: Truck mounted foam sprayers and net guns are authorized.  
Threat level 9+: None.
 
Changer  
Can alter their form, appearance, and/or natural abilities through some manipulation of their bodies. Does not include new powers beyond natural weapons, armor, or durability. Sustained focus fire is recommended. Low-ish priority, all numbers assumed to be equal.  
Threat level 2+: Team is notified as to Changer classification. Basic 'eyes on' protocols initiated, with team members maintaining constant eye contact with one another, and eyes on the changer. Changer is never assumed to be unarmed.  
Threat level 5+: Full eyes on protocols and verbal passwords put into effect. No facility, locked down or otherwise, is assumed to be impregnable.  
Threat level 9+: None
 
Trump  
Can manipulate powers in some capacity, altering, granting, strengthening, weakening or removing them entirely, or has powers that interact solely with the powers of others. PRT squads are encouraged, with capes sidelined, barring all but the most threatening situations. Ranged fire and distance is encouraged, with minimal contact and involvement, to preserve safety of involved capes. Remainder depends on nature of power.
 
Stranger  
Powers predominantly lend themselves to infiltration. Ability in question might bypass defenses, mislead, or help to avoid notice. Full 'eyes on' is SOP where possible. Other safeguards include indiscriminate fire and high priority targeting.  
Threat level 2+: Team is notified as to stranger classification. Areas may be secured and 'taped', to track movement through doors or windows. Passwords in effect.  
Threat level 5+: Constant communication between every team member and a relay in the operations room is implemented, complete with passwords and personal passwords.  
Threat level 9+: Nonlethal shoot-on-sight implemented for anyone who goes 'dark' for any period of time.
