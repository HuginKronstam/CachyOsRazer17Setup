1.1 Gestation

If my dreams came true, I’d become a career author. More realistically, I’d like to make some money doing this while working another job full/part time to actually have enough money to  
buy food. I plan to sell Worm as a series of ebooks somewhere down the line, after I’ve finished.

I like the way Eliezer Yudkowsky put it, if I may toot my own horn. “There are stories which are better than Worm, and stories which were written faster than Worm, but I don’t know of any epic which was ever written faster and better than Worm.”
