# The Good
## Google earth map
I was walking around a giant map, where all the biggest buildings/monuments/artefacts of the world were gathered in one place (like manhatten) In first person or fly by mode i was able to see/read interact with everything, where were also small missions and a butler to assist me in exploring the world. So fucking awesome!
