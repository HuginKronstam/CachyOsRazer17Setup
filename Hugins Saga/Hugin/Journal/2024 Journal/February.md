Gratitude

    - Something mundane - I got a better perspective on my ADHD medication experiment yesterday, and noticed my need for distractions and problems holding attention were prevelant when not on the medication.
    - Something that happened by chance - Martin made food, I most likely would have eaten something unhealthy and expensive, but instead I had a home cooked meal.
    - Something that you made happen - I called Marija

**Mindset**  
_Inversion_  
How can I take better care of my body?  
Inverted  
How can I take worse care of my body?

- Sit hunched over as much as possible
- Try to move as little as possible
- Don't inquire a doctor about any of my ailments
- Eat processed or high sugar foods
- Drink the minimum amount of water
- Build up a bunch of uncompleted tasks and obligations to induce stress
- Don’t do mobility or strength exercises
- Keep the exercise equipment in inconvenient places
- Wear old worn out shoes
- Do many repetitive movements
 
**Gratitude**  
Mundane - Marija got me a spoon and helped me focus  
Something I did - The handover of my assignmenets before Nam went very well, and Simon took responsibility in my stead  
By chance - The VM problem solved itself but made me look good.
